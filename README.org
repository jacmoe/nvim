* My Neovim configuration

[[file:screenshot.png]]

** Introduction
This is a small, and quickly put together, Neovim configuration to allow me to edit my Org-mode files on my weak and old Celeron-based laptop. It is a poor, but powerful, imitation of my [[https://github.com/jacmoe/.doom.d][Doom-Emacs]] setup.

This configuration makes use of:

- [[https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim][packer.nvim]] - use-package inspired plugin/package management for Neovim.
- [[https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim][Nightfox]] - highly customizable theme for vim and neovim with support for lsp, treesitter and a variety of plugins.
- [[https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit][Neogit]] - work-in-progress Magit clone for Neovim that is geared toward the Vim philosophy.
- [[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode][Orgmode.nvim]] - Orgmode clone written in Lua for Neovim 0.7.
- [[https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim][goyo.vim]] - Distraction-free writing in Vim.
- [[https://github.com/ethanholz/nvim-lastplace][nvim-lastplace]] - A Lua rewrite of vim-lastplace
- [[https://github.com/rmagatti/auto-session][Auto Session]] - Seemless automatic session management.
- [[https://github.com/feline-nvim/feline.nvim][feline.nvim]] - A minimal, stylish and customizable statusline / winbar for Neovim written in Lua.
- [[https://github.com/glepnir/galaxyline.nvim][Galaxyline]] - A light-weight and Super Fast statusline plugin.
- [[https://github.com/chentoast/marks.nvim][marks.nvim]] - A better user experience for interacting with and manipulating Vim marks.
